# glog

git push blog server

# example

## custom http server

Here's what a custom server could look like storing repository data in `./repo`:

``` js
var http = require('http');
var glog = require('glog')(__dirname + '/repo');
var ecstatic = require('ecstatic')(__dirname + '/static');

var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    if (glog.test(req.url)) {
        glog(req, res);
    }
    else ecstatic(req, res);
});
server.listen(5000);
```

## git push glog

First run your http server:

```
$ node server.js
```

Now create a new git repo for articles and set up the remote to point at your
glog server:

```
$ git init
$ git remote add publish http://localhost:5000/blog.git
```

Write an article in markdown,
create an annotated tag for the article,
and push to the git blog server:

```
$ echo -e '# beep\nboop' > robot.markdown
$ git add *.markdown && git commit -m 'initial'
$ glog publish robot.markdown 'this is the title text'
$ git push publish master --tags
```

Now the content should be live on your blog, yay!

## authenticating glog

Continuing from the previous example, we'll add user permissions to our glog
server.

To create a user once you've set the `git remote`, from your blog repo do:

```
$ glog useradd substack
Created user substack
To publish as this user add this remote:

http://substack:42aee89a@localhost:5000/blog.git
```

If you don't already have a remote for the blog repo, pass `--remote=REMOTE` to
the `glog useradd` command.

Once users have been configured, everyone who tries to `git push` new articles
will need to have a user token.

Now you can list the glog users with `glog users`:

```
$ glog users
substack
```

For the rest of the user commands, just type `glog` to see the usage page.

# http api

When you attach a glog handler to your server, these routes are installed:

## /blog.git

Used by [pushover](http://github.com/substack/pushover) to make `git push`
deploys work. You can set this as a git remote and interact with it like any
other git endpoint.

Annotated git tags with the filename as the tag name are used to store title
text, publish date, and which files are "published".

## /blog.json

Return a streaming json array of article metadata for all articles.

Optionally, you can set these query string parameters:

* inline - include the article content bodies along with the document metadata
as `'html'` or `'markdown'`

example output:

```
$ curl localhost:5000/blog.json
[
{"file":"robot.markdown","author":"James Halliday","email":"mail@substack.net","date":"Mon Dec 24 15:31:27 2012 -0800","title":"robots are pretty great","commit":"81c62aa62b6770a2f6bdf6865d393daf05930b4a"}

]
```

```
 $ curl localhost:5000/blog.json?inline=html

]
```

## /blog.rss

Return an [atom rss](http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/) stream
with inline content.

## /blog/$FILE.markdown

Fetch a source document $FILE as markdown.

## /blog/$FILE.html

Fetch a source document $FILE.markdown rendered as html.

# methods

```  js
var glog = require('glog')
```

## var blog = glog(opts)

Create a new `blog` handle using `opts.repodir` to store git blog data.

If `opts` is a string, it's taken as the `opts.repodir`.

You can also set `opts.title` and `opts.id` which are used as defaults by the
rss feed, and `opts.highlight` which is the highlight-function used by marked.

All other `opts` are passed through directly to `marked.parse(src, opts)`.

## blog(req, res)

Handle the `(req, res)` in order to serve blog.json and blog.git.

## blog.list()

Return a readable stream of blog article filenames.

## blog.read(file)

Return a readable stream with the contents of `file`.

## blog.data(file)

Return a readable stream with the data for `file`.

## blog.inline(format)

Return a through stream you can pipe `blog.list()` or `blog.data(file)` to that will inline article
contents rendered in `format`: either `'html'` or `'markdown'`.

## blog.test(req.url)

Return whether or not to defer to `blog` for handling routes.

## blog.rss(opts)

Return an [atom rss](http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/) stream
with the blog content inlined in `<content>` tags.

opts are the required elements from the atom spec but you can probably ignore
them and it will still work:

* opts.id - just use your blog address or domain name
* opts.title - blog title to use in the feed
